<p>There once was a man named Joe. Joe was very hungry so he went to the store to buy some bread.
When he went to the store there was no bread and Joe was very disappointed. So, Joe got in his car and drove far out into
the country until he came across a farm. He knew this to be one of the most reputable wheat farms in the area so he thought they
might have bread. When he talked to the farmer, they had no bread, or wheat for that matter, there had been a wheat famine.
Joe then drove further into the country until he came upon a barley field, where he proceeded to steal all of the barley and some
of the wheat mixed in, and built himself a mill from the wood of the surrounding trees. After many months Joe toiled, but he
finally had his bread.</p>
